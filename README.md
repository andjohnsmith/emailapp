# Email Creator 3000

The Email Creator 3000 is a small Java app for a company to create email addresses for new employees. The main method initializes the accounts with the first and last names of the employees, and department information is added with standard input.

## Usage

You can compile the Email Creator from the `emailcreator3000` folder with the command `javac *.java`.

Then, run the application with `java emailcreator3000`.

## Planned Updates

The next steps for this project are as follows:

1. Encode the passwords so they aren't stored as plain text.
2. Set up a SQL database for the created email accounts.
3. Create a GUI window for the user input.
